  about: `I'm currently in my final year as a university systems information analyst. I have a passion for web development and have been honing my skills in various technologies. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React, Python, and Django. I'm also familiar with Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and have some basic knowledge of Astro.
  Beyond web development, I have experience working with different programming paradigms and have a solid understanding of various operating systems like Kali Linux, Ubuntu and Window. I also have an advanced understanding of algorithms and data structures.
  I'm enthusiastic about crafting digital experiences and continually strive to expand my skillset.
